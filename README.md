This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and styling with Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com) .

## Getting Started

First, if the connection with the API gets a CORS error, then run this script:

npx lcp --proxyUrl "http://pretest-qa.dcidev.id"

this scripts will bypass the CORS issue, but if there is no CORS issue, no need to run this script.

Second, run the development server:

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
